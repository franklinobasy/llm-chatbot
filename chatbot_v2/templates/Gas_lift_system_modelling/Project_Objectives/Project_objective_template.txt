~Project/Service Objective
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
a. Develop a comprehensive gas lift optimisation strategy: We will utilise industry
recognised simulation software and advanced production system modelling
techniques to develop a robust gas lift optimisation strategy. By analysing well data,
static and flowing wellbore conditions, and fluid properties, we will identify key areas
for improvement and tailor the optimisation strategy to the specific needs of each
well.
b. Enhance production rates and reservoir recovery by improving gas injection
efficiency: Our objective is to optimise the gas injection rates and distribution within
the wellbore, ensuring the efficient lifting of hydrocarbons to the surface. Through
reliable modelling and prediction of gas lift performance, we will identify the optimal
gas injection rates and depth for new and existing wells requiring gas lift, thereby
maximising production rates and improving overall reservoir recovery.
c. Optimise the gas injection network to utilise available gas: We will conduct a
thorough analysis of the gas injection network to ensure efficient utilisation of
available lift gas volumes. By optimising the lift gas allocation across the wells, we
will maximise the utilisation of the available lift gas, leading to improved production
rates and overall system efficiency.
By achieving these objectives, our Gas Lift Optimisation service aims to significantly
enhance gas lift performance in [COMPANY NAME] Producing Limited.
