~Gas Lift Network Optimisation
Following the estimation of the optimal gas lift injection rate and pressure for each of the
wells based on the creaming curve (as seen in the example in Figure 2 above), there is a
need to determine the best allocation of lift gas considering the constraints in the gas lift
injection network, that will still ensure that the maximum oil is produced from the system.
This involves using the integrated network model containing the calibrated well, reservoir,
and surface layout models and defining the current constraints in the gas lift injection
network (e.g., volume of gas available, compressor output, etc), to evaluate the optimal
system configuration that meets the target objective of maximising oil production.
To ensure maximum value realisation from [COMPANY NAME] Producing Limited gas lift
injection network, this part of the service will cover:
 Physical inspection and definition of injection constraints in the integrated model.
 System optimisation to determine and predict optimal gas lift volume allocation to all
the wells considering the current constraints and layout.
 Evaluation of the ability of the current compression system to meet the required gas
lift injection rate and pressure for the wells.
At the end of this phase, the optimal allocation of gas lift volume to all the wells considering
the current constraints in the injection network while also maximizing the total oil production
rate from the facilities, will be determined and documented.
