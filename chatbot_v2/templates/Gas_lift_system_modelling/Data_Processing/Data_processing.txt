~Data Gathering, Processing and Validation
For the gas lift optimisation project, the following dataset will be required for the wells;
 BHP data
 Reservoir rock and fluid properties
 Production/Welltest data
 FG and SG survey data
 Well completion diagram and evolution (gas lift valves data)
 Deviation survey data
 Production status information
 Surface gas gathering and compression facility information
 Lift gas availability
