~Integrated Production System Modeling (IPSM)
Integrated Production System Modelling (IPSM) involves the development of an integrated
reservoir, wellbore, and surface facilities model to analyse and predict the behaviour of the
entire production system under various operating conditions. IPSM enables engineers to
evaluate the impact of different operating conditions on production performance, identify
bottlenecks, and optimise the overall system efficiency.

Figure 4 below shows a sample integrated production system network model to be created.

To maximise value from [COMPANY NAME] Producing Limited gas lift system, an IPSM
model will be developed and used to identify optimal operating conditions/configurations. In
this scope, we will:
 develop a detailed reservoir model using MBAL/DC that accurately represents the
subsurface characteristics, including reservoir geometry, rock properties, and fluid
behaviour.
 Integrate well models from the gas lift modelling phase and build well models for
wells whose production dynamics is critical to the overall gas lift system optimisation.
 develop an integrated production facility network model for using GAP, to simulate
production performance while considering reservoir, well and facility constraints.
 calibrate integrated reservoir, well and facility models using available production data
to ensure accurate representation of the production system&#39;s behaviour.
Using the IPSM framework, we will optimise strategies to enhance production rates,
minimise operational costs, and maximise resource recovery.
