~Gaslift Modelling and Performance Review Scenario

Following the identification and selection of gas lift candidates, our team of experts will:
 develop a robust gas lift performance model for both new and existing wells using
PROSPER, accounting for key factors such as gas injection rate, injection mandrel
depth, and other relevant parameters.
 calibrate the gas lift performance models to recent historical well test data.
 simulate different gas lift injection scenarios (rate, injection depth, etc.) and evaluate
their impact on the production rate.
 identify the most optimal operating conditions and gas lift settings.
In determining the optimal operating condition and gas lift settings for each candidate, our
team will pay attention to defining:
1. Optimum Gas Lift Injection Rate Per Well
One of the critical factors in gas lift optimization is determining the optimum injection rate
that strikes the ideal balance between gas and liquid flow rates. Our team will employ
bespoke modelling techniques to:
 simulate various injection rate scenarios, assessing the impact on well performance.
 identify the optimal gas lift injection rate per well that maximises production rate,
while addressing vertical lift issues as seen in Figure below.(attach figure)

2. Optimum Gas Lift Injection Depth Per Well
Determining the optimal gas lift injection depth is crucial for effective gas lift operations. Our
team will:
 conduct a comprehensive analysis of the well geometry, fluid characteristics, static
and flowing wellbore conditions to model different injection depth based on the
available mandrels.
 evaluate retrofitting options for wells without gas lift mandrels or sub-optimally placed
mandrels.

An optimum gas injection rate and depth will significantly enhance the overall performance of
the gas lift system, leading to increased production performance for [COMPANY NAME]
