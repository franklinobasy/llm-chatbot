# Routine Gas Lift System Recalibration/Surveillance System Setup

Routine gas lift system recalibration/optimisation is a vital practice in maintaining the
efficiency and effectiveness of gas lift operations. It involves periodic assessments and
adjustments to ensure the gas lift system is performing optimally. To ensure maximum value
realisation from the gas lift system optimisation system, the scheduled routing calibration/
surveillance activities will include;
 Performance review and monitoring for all gas lifted wells (status and scenario
analysis)
 Gas lift performance benchmarking
 Physical inspection at wellsite
 Gas lift model recalibration and optimisation
 Redefine optimisation strategies using recalibrated models
 Quick Economics (estimated oil gain vs cost)

At the end of this phase, a gas lift surveillance program will be setup for [COMPANY NAME]
Producing Limited. This will enable the asset team to have a comprehensive performance
review of the gas lift system, identify optimisation opportunities, and optimise for improved
performance.
