# Cost Benefit Analysis


Gas lift operations play a crucial role in optimizing production rates and enhancing reservoir
performance. To ensure the economic viability of implementing and optimising gas lift
systems, conducting a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is essential. By evaluating the
upfront investment costs, operational expenses, and potential production gains associated
with new gas lift installations or existing gas lift system adjustment, asset teams can make
informed decisions about the profitability and feasibility of these production enhancement
opportunities.

To ensure maximum profitability from gas lifting operations, this part of the service will cover:
 Generation of 10-years production forecast for the gas lifted wells based on the
selected optimal gas lift setting.
 Generation of representative CAPEX (if applicable) and OPEX cost required to
efficiently manage the gas lift operations on a day-to-day basis, which will serve as
an input into the economic modelling.
 Setting up an economical model based on the terms of either PPTA or PIA fiscal
regime to evaluate the incremental profitability of the recommendations (gas lift
optimisation or new wells to be gas lifted).
 Evaluate key economic indicators (such as NPV, IRR, UOC, Payback period, etc.) for
each identified gas lift optimisation opportunity.
At the end of this phase, the gas lift optimisation opportunities, or new wells to be gas lifted,
will be ranked to identify the most profitable opportunities to execute within the short-term to
mid-term period.
