~Production System Optimisation Workshop for Operationalisation
To ensure continuous production/injection system optimisation and effective
operationalisation of the recommendations and opportunities from the project, a detailed
post-project workshop will be organised. The workshop will cover the following:
 Detailed engagement on the identified opportunities for gas lift optimisation
 Detailed engagement on gas lift performance diagnosis and surveillance system
setup
 Detailed engagement on best practices to be employed in recalibrating the
integrated models and ensuring continuous injection optimisation
 Detailed engagement on opportunities to improve surveillance data acquisition and
control management to ensure more efficient gas lift operations.
