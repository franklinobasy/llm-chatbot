# Introduction

Gas lift operations are an integral part of the oil and gas production process, particularly in
mature fields where declining reservoir pressure, and vertical lift insufficiency poses
challenges. To overcome these challenges, the injection of gas is essential to lift
hydrocarbons to the surface. However, inefficient gas lift operations can have detrimental
effects on production rates, operating costs, and overall recovery from wells. Most E&amp;P
operators face several obstacles when it comes to optimising gas lift operations, which can
hinder their ability to achieve peak performance and profitability.
One of the key challenges lies in accurately modelling and predicting the performance of gas
lift systems due to the complex nature of reservoir dynamics, wellbore conditions, and fluid
properties. These challenges lead to suboptimal gas injection rates and inefficient lift
operations. Moreover, the lack of continuous optimisation and redefinition of gas lift strategy
in the face of dynamic production realities escalate into production performance issues,
resulting in prolonged periods of reduced production and missed opportunities for
optimisation.
To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive Gas Lift Modelling and
Optimisation service that combines expertise in integrated production system modelling and
a robust experience in production system optimisation. Our service offers a tailored solution
designed to overcome the challenges in optimising gas lift operations, leading to increased
production and cost savings.
