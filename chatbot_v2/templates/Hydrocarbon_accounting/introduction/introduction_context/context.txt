Nigeria's oil and gas industry is a pivotal component of the country's socio-economic fabric, 
characterized by significant hydrocarbon reserves that have attracted international investment 
and driven economic growth. Despite its potential, the sector faces challenges such as resource mismanagement, 
environmental issues, and social inequality. Hydrocarbon accounting is crucial for ensuring accurate production 
tracking, equitable revenue distribution, and regulatory compliance. However, current practices are hampered by 
data inconsistencies and inefficiencies. The proposed hydrocarbon accounting solution aims to address these challenges, 
fostering transparency, accountability, and sustainability within Nigeria's oil and gas sector.
